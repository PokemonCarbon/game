# Pokémon Carbon

A built from scratch fully modular Pokémon game engine.

## About
Pokémon Carbon is a moddable Pokémon game designed with the original intention
of making an experience where the player may explore all the known Pokémon regions
through extended normal gameplay. Over time, this idea has expanded to make
the game moddable and as such now includes a Region API that the base game
itself is built with. The Region API now allows developers who wish to extend
the Carbon experience may now do so, and their Region will be explorable to
the player after defeating the original Kanto Region and unlocking the ferry
from Vermilion City.
