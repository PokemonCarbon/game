# Pokémon Carbon

A built from scratch fully modular Pokémon game engine written entirely in vanilla Javascript runnable in your browser today.

## About
Pokémon Carbon is a moddable Pokémon game designed with the original intention of making an experience where the player may explore all the known Pokémon regions through extended normal gameplay. Over time, this idea has expanded to make the game moddable and as such now includes a Region API that the base game itself is built with. The Region API now allows developers who wish to extend the Carbon experience may now do so, and their Region will be explorable to the player after defeating the original Kanto Region and unlocking the ferry from Vermilion City.
